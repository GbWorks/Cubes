# Cubes

Cubes is an application framework, created to help building modular applications. It provides application with basic 
functionality like scheduling, database access, email sending, excel files creation and handling.

Cubes is based on `Applications` that are discovered and loaded dynamically on startup. We can create web applications, 
REST APIs, scheduled daemons and other kinds of applications using the foundations provided by Cubes.
